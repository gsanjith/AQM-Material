- Class: text
  Output: Welcome to the lesson in Linear Regression.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The library() function is used to load libraries which are groups of functions and datasets. The MASS library is a useful large collection of datasets. Load the MASS library. 
  CorrectAnswer: library(MASS)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='library(MASS)')
  Hint: Load the MASS library using library()

- Class: text
  Output: We will be working on the Boston data set in the MASS library, which records the median housevalue (medv) for 506 neighbourhoods of Boston, along with 13 predictor variables. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Load the Boston dataset into housing.  
  CorrectAnswer: housing <- Boston
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='housing <- Boston')
  Hint: Use <- to load the Boston data set
  
- Class: text
  Output: The first thing one should always do after loading data is to make sure it loaded as expected. We do this by looking at various parts of the data using certain R functions.
  
  

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The head() function lets you see the first few rows. Use head() to see the first few rows on the newly loaded housing data set. 
  CorrectAnswer: head(housing)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='head(housing)')
  Hint: head(housing) will perform the required function. 

- Class: text
  Output: Another useful operation is to see the size or the dimensions of the data set. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use dim() to see the dimensions of the housing dataset. 
  CorrectAnswer: dim(housing)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='dim(housing)')
  Hint: Try again 

- Class: text
  Output: To find out more about the data set, we can type ?Boston. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Try it and pay attention to nox and lstat headers. 
  CorrectAnswer: ?Boston
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='?Boston')
  Hint: Try again. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use attach() to attach the housing data set so R knows where to look in when we perform the subsequent operations. 
  CorrectAnswer: attach(housing)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='attach(housing)')
  Hint: Try again. 

- Class: text
  Output: Let us now fit a simple linear regression model with medv as the response and lstat as the predictor. 

- Class: text
  Output: The syntax to perform a linear regression is lm(y~x) where y is the response variable and x is the predictor. It is important to attach the dataset before running the regression. Else, R will not know where to look for the variables x and y.


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use lm to run a regression on median value (medv) as the response and lstat as the predictor and store it in reg.
  CorrectAnswer: reg <- lm(medv~lstat)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='reg <- lm(medv~lstat)')
  Hint: reg <- ...

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: For detailed information on the regression fit, we can use summary(reg). Try it. 
  CorrectAnswer: summary(reg)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='summary(reg)')
  Hint: Try again!

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We would like to also derive confidence intervals on the coefficient estimates. Use the confint() command.
  CorrectAnswer: confint(reg)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='confint(reg)')
  Hint: Try again!
